# erm what the sigma
So...you might be wondering why this even exists.

A while ago, some community members kept saying skibidi and sigma in chat, so I jokingly threatened to force them to use 
Gen Alpha language pack on Unifier if they kept saying those stuff.

Well, here we are now. Brainrot for Unifier is real, thanks to the informal and somewhat chaotic nature of the Unifier
comunity.

(Disclaimer: I actually needed a whole brainrot dictionary to make this possible. I'm too old to keep up with the trends
lmao)
